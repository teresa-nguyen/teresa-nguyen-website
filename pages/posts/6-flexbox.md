# Helpful Resources for Flexbox

Did I mention that CSS is hard? Making something look the way you want is hard, but Flexbox makes it more manageable. I have been using these resources to help me when using Flexbox. I hope they can help you, too.

1. [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
   <br />This is my go-to guide for Flexbox. Go here first for all your Flexbox needs.

2. [https://flexbox.help/](https://flexbox.help/)
   <br />This visualizer allows you to change different Flexbox properties and see the changes in real-time.

3. [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox)
   <br />Mozilla Developer Network is great for everything about the web. If you need a detailed explanation of Flexbox, this is a great resource.
